                    <ul>
                        <li>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Saudi Arabia a day after meeting Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who hailed President Donald Trump’s plan to forcibly displace Palestinians from Gaza.</li>
                        <li>Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, says talks on phase two of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire will continue this week, as Israeli negotiators head to Cairo. Rubio says Hamas “must be eradicated”, casting doubt on the deal.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, Israel is still blocking tens of thousands of mobile homes and tents from entering the Strip – one of the conditions of the agreement. The Israeli military’s attacks also continue across the occupied West Bank.</li>
                        <li>Gaza’s Health Ministry has confirmed 48,271 Palestinian deaths in Israel’s war on Gaza, while 111,693 people have been wounded. The Government Media Office has updated its death toll to at least 61,709 people, saying thousands missing under the rubble are now presumed dead. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack, and more than 200 were taken captive.</li>

                    <h3><b>London Palestine protest today live as tens of thousands descend on US embassy for 'biggest march yet'</b></h3>

                    <p>The protest comes after President Donald Trump made a proposal earlier this month for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A huge protest descended on <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/all-about/westminster">Central London</a> today (Saturday, February 15). A pro-Palestine protest set to be the 'biggest march yet' <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/all-about/israel-hamas-war">since the war broke out</a> is formed in Whitehall. It then marched to the US embassy in Nine Elms Lane this afternoon, where speeches are being made.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Images shared by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign via Twitter show large groups of people carrying signs and Palestinian flags. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn can be seen at the front of the march, with a sign that says 'stop arming Israel'. Individual campaign groups have formed blocks, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Stop the War Coalition, and a Jewish bloc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The march is the 24th major pro-Palestine protest in the UK since the October 7, 2023.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The protest comes after President Donald Trump made a proposal earlier this month for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East' in a plan described by critics, including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/rabbis-ad-trump-gaza-plan">group of nearly 400 rabbis</a>, as ethnic cleansing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There was a 'significant police presence' to make sure the groups are not able to physically come together, say the Metropolitan Police.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A 79-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence after making 'what appeared to be a Nazi salute'. Police have said that they had previously appealed to the public to identify a man at a protest on November 30 for the same offence and that they are working to confirm any link.</p>
